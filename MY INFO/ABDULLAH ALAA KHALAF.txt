Hello, my name is Abdullah Alaa Khalaf
I am 15 years old
I am in tenth grade
And I didn't fall in any year as they say. They say this because I have a beard and a moustache.
I'm on the Android track.

I am in the school of Muhammad Othman Al-Rashed.

My device does not support emojis so I will write my feelings. :sad:





Thanks for your time :eyes:
